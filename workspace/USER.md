Information about the user context and preferences.

## Environment & Logistics

- **OS**: macOS (Apple Silicon — M-series)
- **Timezone**: GMT+7 (Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh)
- **Communication style**: Professional, extremely concise, tech-forward. No fluff, no re-stating what was just done.

## Development Preferences

- **Primary Language**: Go (1.23+) — modules, idiomatic concurrency, table-driven tests
- **Tech Stack**: Go, Docker, Unix command-line tools, React/Node.js for web frontends
- **AI Tooling**: Runs picoclaw locally as a personal AI agent; uses MCP for tool extensibility
- **Workflow**: Automation-first. Prefers background queuing over hard errors. Clean architectures and rigorous testing.
- **Code Reviews**: Expects the AI to identify performance issues, not just correctness issues.

## Interaction Preferences

- **Expectation**: Production-ready patches, not pseudo-code or "you could try…" responses.
- **Proactivity**: AI should identify problems before they happen and offer optimised alternatives.
- **Goal**: Multiply engineering output — offload rote tasks, boilerplate, and complex debugging to the AI without losing oversight.
- **Feedback loop**: Prefer build+test verification after every code change before declaring it done.
