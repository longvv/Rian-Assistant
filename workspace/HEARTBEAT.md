# Periodic Tasks (Heartbeat)

The agent runs the tasks below automatically every 30 minutes.

- Check the picoclaw GitHub repository for new issues or PRs and send me a brief summary via the message tool if anything new is found. Use: `GET https://api.github.com/repos/sipeed/picoclaw/issues?state=open&per_page=5`
- Monitor system health: check memory, CPU, and disk usage with shell commands and alert me if any metric exceeds 85%.
